            <h2>Abstract</h2> 
            
                <p> This memo amends <a href="#">RFC 1149</a>, "A Standard for the Transmission of IP
                    Datagrams on Avian Carriers", with Quality of Service information.
                    This is an experimental, not recommended standard</p>
            
                <p>Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
                datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
                form.</p>
            
            <h2>Overview and Rational</h2>
            
                <p>   The following quality of service levels are available: Concorde,
                    First, Business, and Coach.  Concorde class offers expedited data
                    delivery.  One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is
                    the only networking technology that earns frequent flyer miles, plus
                    the Concorde and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles per
                    packet.  Ostriches are an alternate carrier that have much greater
                    bulk transfer capability but provide slower delivery, and require the
                    use of bridges between domains.</p>
                 
                <p>The service level is indicated on a per-carrier basis by bar-code
                    markings on the wing.  One implementation strategy is for a bar-code
                    reader to scan each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue
                    it in the proper queue, gated to prevent exit until the proper time.
                    The carriers may sleep while enqueued.</p>
                     
                <p>For secure networks, carriers may have classes Prime or Choice.
                    Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption.
                    Some distributors have been known to falsely classify Choice carriers
                    as Prime.</p>
                    
                <p>Packets MAY be marked for deletion using RED paint while enqueued.</p>

                <p>Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as
                shown:</p>

              <p>Avian carriers normally bypass bridges and tunnels but will seek out
                worm hole tunnels.  When carrying web traffic, the carriers may
                digest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation.
                The carriers may be confused by mirrors.</p>

               <p>Round-robin queueing is not recommended. Robins make for well-tuned
                networks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.</p>

               <p>A BOF was held at the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed
                entry, so we don't know the results other than we're sure they think
                MPLS is great.  Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have
                been met with resistance.</p>

               <p>NATs are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying
                the brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY
                eat the NATs.</p>
             
                <p>Encapsulation may be done with saran wrappers.  Unintentional
                encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation
                being messy and the packets mangled.</p>
             
                <p>Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced
                standards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source
                routes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point.</p>
             
               <p>The ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding
                technology, Penguins, but that won't fly.</p> 
             
               <p>Multicasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone
                device.  Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is
                being pruned.  The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree.  The
                carriers have an average TTL of 15 years, so their use in expanding
                ring searches is limited.</p> 
             
               <p>Additional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's
                guide.</p>

            <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

                <p>Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
                measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
                are used in a tactical environment.</p>
